# IHC Netflix

IHC netflix its a project was developed in the context of a university discipline called Projeto e I. de S. Interativos. Which aims to gamification any app or website that already exists and has no gamification. I chose to create a small quiz system with points related to Netflix series and movies. This is a prototype and all data is a mock.
